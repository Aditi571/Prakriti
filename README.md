# Prakriti

Human Prakriti

Ayurveda is based on the idea that the world is made up of five elements -
space, water, earth, fire and air. A combination of each element results in three
humors, or doshas, known as ‘vata’
,
‘pitta’ and ‘kapha’.

We impemented CNN on different parts of the face after masking to achieve the desired result.
